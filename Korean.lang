helptopic.contracts.title	20	CONTRACTS	계약서
helptopic.contracts.body	0	Contracts are agreements with Settlements to complete a series of tasks for a reward in influence, money, or just a temporary increase in the price of a product for the duration of the contract. To create the Contract, Settlements look at what the Player can produce with the buildings they have and compare that to the Products currently demanded in their Shops. They then draft the Contract with an objective, a time limit, the reward, and the penalties for failing to complete the objective in the allotted time. \n\nWhen a Settlement spawns a Contract, it will appear as an icon above the Town Center. Clicking on the icon will open the Contract for review.  From there you can Accept, Reject or Hide for now, which closes the Contract panel so you can accomplish other tasks. Each Contract will be available for up to six months after spawned; after that a new one is created. \n\nOnce Accepted, the Contract it is added to your Contract List that is accessible in the Contract Tab in the HQ Building. There you can review the objectives, how much time is left to complete the contract, and the rewards and penalties associated with it. Your Contract list can only hold three contracts so you will have to be picky about your selection. You can also review a Contract by clicking on the Contract Notification on the main screen.

helptopic.techtree.body	0	The Tech Tree is your path to new inventions, innovation, and prosperity. Use it to find new avenues to progress upward to the top of the industrial age! It is broken up into several smaller Tech Trees which will get you grant access to new recipes and building enhancements that are specific to that Tech Tree. \n\nTo unlock these upgrades you will need to spend some time and money researching each recipe and building enhancement. Investing deeper into a Tech Tree will result in Recipes that are more profitable but expensive, time-consuming to complete, and difficult to fabricate.   \n\nAt the start of each game (unless disabled), you gain number of free unlocks that are used to jumpstart your business. This number of unlocks varies depending on the Difficulty you selected at game creation.\n\n{link, Rural Trees, Rural Trees}\nThe Rural Trees specialize in Food and Drink Recipes that can consist of simple Fruits and Vegetables for your friendly neighborhood Farmer’s Market as well as Livestock Recipes that provide Leather and Wool that can be used to take your first step into other industries like Textile or Carpentry. You will also find high-profit Recipes like Pizza and Burgers here not to mention some profitable Smoothies and Juices for production.\n\n{link, Light Ind.

With those two alone you can make Products like Bottles and Ceramics or Cans and Steel Barrels, which are used to contain various other products in other Trees. You will also find Recipes for making more intricate Products like Light Bulbs and Refrigerators to be used in every chef’s kitchen and Adhesive and Paint in every handy-person's toolbox. \n\n{link, Auxiliary Trees, Auxiliary Trees}\nWith the Auxiliary Trees you will be able to improve the backbone of your industrial empire. You will be able to add Transports Depots like the Truck Depot and Train Terminal from here as well as add more Destination Trucks and Destination Slots.

tutorialpart1.step6.objective0.description	70	Buy a Full Build Permit	전 건물 허가증을 구매하세요.
tutorialpart1.step7.description	180	When we start building we will need to be careful. Placing buildings too close to a Settlement will cause a loss of Influence with them.	건설을 시작할 때 조심하세요. 정착지에 건물이 너무 가까울 경우 영향력을 상실하게 됩니다.
tutorialpart1.step7.objective0.description	70	Click on Chapwick Overview Tab	Chapwick 개요 탭을 클릭하세요
tutorialpart1.step8.description	180	Influence is our reputation with a Settlement. If our Influence drops equal to or less than Zero we won’t be able to build in that Region.	영향력은 정착지의 우리에 대한 평판입니다. 만약 영향력이 0 이하로 떨어질 경우 해당 지역에 더 이상 건설할 수 없게 됩니다.
tutorialpart1.step8.objective0.description	70	Close Chapwick Town Center Panel	Chapwick 마을 센터 창을 닫으세요
tutorialpart1.step9.description	180	Now let’s start building our first Production line. We will need a Water Siphon to collect the Raw Resource, Water, and a Warehouse to store and distribute it.	이제 첫 번째 생산 라인을 만들어 봅시다. 우리는 원자재인 물을 수집하기 위해 물 사이펀이 필요하고, 저장 및 분배를 위해 창고가 필요합니다.
tutorialpart1.step9.objective0.description	70	Open Gatherer Tab in the Construction Bar	건축 바에서 자원건물 탭을 여세요.
tutorialpart1.step10.description	180	A Water Siphon, like other Gatherers, collects a raw resource to be used by Farms and Factories to generate other Products.	물 사이펀은 다른 자원건물처럼 다른 생산품을 만들기 위해 농장이나 공장에서 사용되는 원자재를 수집합니다.
tutorialpart1.step10.objective0.description	70	Select Water Siphon in the Construction Bar.	건축 바에서 물 사이펀을 선택하세요
tutorialpart1.step10.objective1.description	70	Place a Water Siphon in the highlighted area.	지정된 위치에 물 사이펀을 건설하세요
tutorialpart1.step11.description	180	After placing the Water Siphon, it will need a few Harvesters placed. A Harvester collects a Raw Resource and brings it back to the Gatherer.	물 사이펀을 건설한 다음, 몇 개의 채집기가 필요할 겁니다. 채집기는 원자재를 채집하고 자원건물로 가져올 것입니다.
tutorialpart1.step11.objective0.description	70	Place 2 Harvesters in highlighted area	지정된 위치에 두 개의 채집기를 건설하세요
tutorialpart1.step11.objective1.description	70	Close Gatherer Construction Panel	자원건물 건축 창을 닫으세요
tutorialpart1.step12.description	180	Now we need to place Roads to get the Water to the Water Siphon. Roads are the only way Trucks move across the Map.	이제 물 사이펀에 물을 가져 오기 위해 도로를 건설해야 합니다. 트럭이 지점과 지점 사이를 이동하기 위한 유일한 수단은 도로입니다.
tutorialpart1.step12.objective0.description	70	Open Road Construction Panel	도로 건축 창을 여세요
tutorialpart1.step12.objective1.description	70	Place the Road by clicking and dragging over the highlights.	지정된 위치 위에서 클릭 및 드래그를 통해 도로를 건설하세요
tutorialpart1.step13.description	180	Hm, looks like the roads aren't connected properly. Make sure they always overlap; just having them touching isn't enough.	음, 도로가 제대로 연결된 것 같지 않습니다. 지점을 연결하는 것이 끝이 아닙니다. 항상 도로를 겹치도록 건설하세요.
tutorialpart1.step13.objective0.description	70	Fix the Road placement	도로를 고치세요
tutorialpart1.step13.objective1.description	70	Close Road Construction Panel	도로 건축 창을 닫으세요
tutorialpart1.step14.description	180	The Water Siphon is fully operational! We now need a place for the Water to go to. Let’s put down that Warehouse we mentioned before.	물 사이펀이 완벽하게 작동하네요! 이제 우리는 물이 갈 곳이 필요합니다. 전에 말했던 창고를 건설합시다.
tutorialpart1.step14.objective0.description	70	Open Logistics Tab in the Construction Bar	건축 바에서 물류 탭을 여세요
tutorialpart1.step15.description	180	The Warehouse acts as a hub for a small area on the map. Once placed, it will coordinate the collection and distribution of Products amongst the buildings within its radius.	창고는 맵의 좁은 영역에서 허브의 역할을 합니다. 한번 건설되면 반경 내 건물들 사이의 생산품의 수집과 분배를 조절할 것입니다.
tutorialpart1.step15.objective0.description	70	Click on Warehouse in Logistics Construction Bar	물류 건축 바에서 창고를 클릭하세요
tutorialpart1.step15.objective1.description	70	Place a Warehouse in the highlighted area.	지정된 위치에 창고를 건설하세요
tutorialpart1.step16.description	180	When a building generates a Product, it will send that Product to the Warehouse. The Water Siphon, for example, will send Water to the Warehouse to be stored.	건물에서 상품이 만들어지면 창고로 보낼 것입니다. 예를 들어 물 사이펀은 물을 창고로 보내 저장할 것입니다.
tutorialpart1.step16.objective0.description	70	Place the Road between Water Siphon and Warehouse.	물 사이펀과 창고 사이에 도로를 건설하세요
tutorialpart1.step17.description	180	Once stored, the Water is transported to where it is needed. Like a Crop Farm, which uses Water to generate Farm Produce that can be sold or used for other Recipes.	일단 저장되면 물은 필요한 곳에 이송됩니다. 작물 농장처럼 물을 사용해 다른 레시피에 사용되거나 판매될 수 있는 상품을 생산합니다.
tutorialpart1.step17.objective0.description	70	Open Farms Tab in the Construction Bar	건축 바에서 농장 탭을 여세요
tutorialpart1.step17.objective1.description	70	Click on Crop Farm in Farming Construction Bar	농장 건축 바에서 작물 농장을 클릭하세요
tutorialpart1.step17.objective2.description	70	Place a Crop Farm in highlighted area.	지정된 위치에 작물 농장을 건설하세요
tutorialpart1.step18.description	180	Farms are like Gatherers except they use Fields instead of Harvesters which don’t need Roads to operate. Just add Water and maybe some Wheat to generate the desired Farm Produce.	농장은 채집기 대신 필드를 사용한다는 것만 빼면 자원건물과 같습니다. 물과 어쩌면 약간의 밀을 이용하여 원하는 농작물을 생산하세요.
tutorialpart1.step18.objective0.description	70	Place 3 Fields in Highlighted area	지정된 위치에 세 개의 필드를 건설하세요
tutorialpart1.step18.objective1.description	70	Close Farm Construction Panel	농장 건축 창을 닫으세요
tutorialpart1.step19.description	180	Once we place a road between the Warehouse and the Crop Farm, the Warehouse will begin sending Water to the Crop Farm automatically.	창고와 농장 사이에 도로를 배치하면 창고에서 자동으로 작물 농장에 물을 보냅니다.
tutorialpart1.step19.objective0.description	70	Place the Road between Warehouse and Crop Farm	창고와 작물 농장 사이에 도로를 건설하세요
tutorialpart1.step20.description	180	Our Crop Farm is ready to Produce something, let us set its Production to Vegetables.	우리의 작물 농장은 뭔가를 생산할 준비가 완료되었습니다. 생산을 야채로 설정합시다.
tutorialpart1.step20.objective0.description	70	Set the Crop Farm’s Production to Vegetables	작물 농장의 생산을 야채로 설정하세요
tutorialpart1.step21.description	180	Congratulations, we now have a working vegetable production line! But we are not done yet. Sometimes we will want to fine-tune our production lines. For that, we use Manual Mode.	우리는 이제 야채 생산 라인을 완성했습니다. 축하합니다! 하지만 끝난 것이 아닙니다. 가끔씩 우리는 생산 라인을 세부 조정을 하고 싶기도 합니다. 이를 위해 수동 모드를 사용할 수 있습니다.
tutorialpart1.step21.objective0.description	70	Click Water Siphon	물 사이펀을 클릭하세요
tutorialpart1.step21.objective1.description	70	Open the Destination Tab	목적지 탭을 여세요
tutorialpart1.step21.objective2.description	70	Click on [Auto] button to turn on Manual Mode	[Auto(자동)] 버튼을 클릭해 수동 모드로 변경하세요
tutorialpart1.step22.description	180	In Manual Mode, we forgo using the Warehouse and send Product directly to where we feel it is needed most. For example, we can send Water right from the Water Siphon to the Crop Farm.	수동 모드에서 우리는 상품을 창고를 거치지 않고 가장 필요하다고 생각되는 곳에 바로 보낼 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, 우리는 물 사이펀에서 물을 작물 농장에 바로 보낼 수 있습니다.
